	<p>Certification is achieved by taking the CEH examination after having either attended training at an Accredited Training Center (ATC),[2] or completed through EC-Council's learning portal, iClass. If a candidate opts to self-study, an application must be filled out and proof submitted of two years of relevant information security work experience. Those without the required two years of information security related work experience can request consideration of educational background.[3] The current version of the CEH is V12, released in September 2022.[4] The exam, which uses the same EC-Council exam code (312-50) as the earlier versions, has 125 multiple-choice questions and a 4-hour time limit.[5][6]

	<p>Members holding the CEH/CNDA designation (as well as other EC-Council certifications) must seek re-certification under this program every three years, for a minimum of 120 credits.[7]
