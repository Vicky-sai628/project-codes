    	<h1>About Ethical Hacking</h1>

	<p>When we talk about Ethical Hacking, it is explicitly implied that we are talking about hacking that is based on ethical or moral values, without any ill intent. Ethical Hacking is defined as any form of hacking that is authorized by the owner of the target system. It can also refer to the process of taking active security measures to defend systems from hackers with malicious intentions on data privacy.

     </ul>

	<p>From a technical standpoint, Ethical Hacking is the process of bypassing or cracking security measures implemented by a system to find out vulnerabilities, data breaches, and potential threats. It is only deemed ethical if the regional or organizational cyber laws/rules are followed. This job is formally known as penetration testing. As the name suggests, this practice involves trying to infiltrate the system and documenting the steps involved in it.

			<h4>White Hat Hackers</h4>

			<p>On the dark web, these are the right people who come to our aid. White hat hackers, also known as ethical hackers, are cybersecurity experts who assist the government and businesses by performing penetration testing and identifying security flaws. Ethical hackers use a variety of techniques to protect themselves from black hat hackers and other cybercriminals. They break into our system with the good intention of finding vulnerabilities and assisting you in removing viruses and malware.

			<h4> Black Hat Hackers</h4>

			<p>These days, black hat hackers are the main perpetrators of cybercrime. The majority of the time, the agenda of a black hat hacker is monetary. These hackers look for flaws in individual computers in businesses and banking systems. They can hack into your network and gain access to your personal, business, and financial information by exploiting any loopholes they find.

			<h4>Grey Hat Hackers</h4>

			<p>Grey Hat Hackers fall in between white and black hat hackers. Grey hat hackers may not use their skills for personal gain, they can however have both good and bad intentions. For instance, a hacker who hacks into an organization and finds some vulnerability may leak it over the internet or inform the organization about it. Nevertheless, as soon as hackers use their hacking skills for personal gain they become black hat hackers.
